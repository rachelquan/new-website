I'm a rising senior citizen 👵 studying **[CS (Cow Science)](https://www.cs.ucdavis.edu/)** 🐮 and **[🅱usiness](https://gsm.ucdavis.edu/node/11963)** at **[UC Davis](https://www.ucdavis.edu/)**, the number one agricultural school in the nation. My dreams before graduating are to milk a cow and drive a tractor.

Jokes aside, I'm a budding **software engineer** who loves transforming ideas into something tangible using code and solving challenging technical problems with other engineers! Outside of coding, I also enjoy **organizing hackathons** (aka tech popup camps for broke college students with free food and swag) and **creating tight-knitted communities** through various leadership roles that I've taken on before on campus!

In all honesty, I'm always trying my best and continuing to figure shit out! Before quarantine, I enjoy spending my free time running, playing tennis, and biking. Now, I spend my free time rewatching shows with crass humor such as Community or That 70's Show and talking to my imaginary friends.

## I'm currently..

- Working at [Cisco](http://cisco.com) as a **software engineering intern**!
- Organizing [HackDavis](http://hackdavis.io), UC Davis's annual hackathon!

## What's next for me..

- Surviving [Operating Systems course](https://cs.ucdavis.edu/schedules-classes/ecs-150-operating-systems-system-programming) 🥵
- Attending [Grace Hopper Conference](https://ghc.anitab.org/attend/), my first tech conference ever, as UC Davis's Grace Hopper Scholar! 👩‍💻
